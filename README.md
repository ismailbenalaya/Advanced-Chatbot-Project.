A Python chatbot designed to provide context-aware responses by matching user input with predefined answers using fuzzy matching.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher

## Installation

   ```

2. Ensure Python is installed on your system. Run the chatbot:

## Example Usage

The chatbot operates in a conversational loop. Type your input, and the bot will respond based on its knowledge base.

### Sample Conversation

```plaintext
You: hello
Bot: Hey there! How can I assist you today?

You: what is your name
Bot: I am your friendly chatbot! How can I assist you today?

You: tell me a joke
Bot: Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts!

You: goodbye
Bot: See you soon! Take care!
```

The chatbot supports a variety of commands such as greetings, asking for help, and general queries. Expand the knowledge base in the source code to customize responses.
